					<h1> Print Books in Wisconsin Libraries, 2011-2017 </h1>
					<p> Are print books going by the wayside as electronic readers, audiobooks, and podcasts become more popular? <br>
						This map samples 15 libraries around Wisconsin to examine how many print books they've carried over the past 7 years. <br>
						Use the slider and skip buttons to go forward or backward in time. <br>
						Click on a circle to see which library it represents, and how many print books that library carried in a given year.
					  The legend in the lower right lets you know which year you're currently looking at, and gives you an idea as to what the size of the circles mean.
				    <br> How big are the communities these libraries serve?  Toggle population data on and off using the controls in the top right. </p>
